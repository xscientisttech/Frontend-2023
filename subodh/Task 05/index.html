                    <h2>The extraction does not work. Why?</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are several reasons why the extraction might fail. The website you entered might be not be
                        publicly accessible or it might be protected by a login. Very slow or large websites might also
                        cause issues.

                    <p>
                        And sometimes there are a lot of people using extract.pics at the same time which can cause
                        performance issues on our side. In this case you should try again later or try a different website.
                        We are continuously working on improving the performance of our service.

                    <p>
                        Sometimes other websites block the download of images from their website. In this case you can
                        right-click the images and press "Save image as..." or try to open the image in a new tab and
                        download it from there.

                        When trying to download multiple images at once, some images might not be included in the ZIP file,
                        because they could not be downloaded. In this case you can try to download them individually. If the
                        download does not work at all, please contact us.

                    <p>
                        Everytime you start the extraction process the website you entered is openend in a Google Chrome
                        browser. We then apply multiple different methods to find all the images (and even SVG elements) on
                        the website. After that the images are analyzed to show useful information like type, name and size.

                    <h2>Does it work with dynamic websites?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Yes. Every website is viewed just like you view them in your browser. We use the latest version of
                        the Google Chrome browser to process the websites you provide. After loading your website we execute
                        JavaScript and wait for any requests to finish before starting the extraction process.

                    <h2>How many images are extracted?</h2>
                    <p>
                        After the server navigates to the website you provided, it scrolls down really fast for a few
                        seconds to find as many images as possible. Every image that the website loads in those first ~10
                        seconds is then sent back to you. Tracking pixels and missing or invalid images are automatically
                        removed.

                    <h2>What does "Image preview not available" mean?</h2>
                    <p>
                        This can have several reasons. The most common is that the webserver, the image is stored on, does
                        not allow the image to be loaded/shown on other websites. If that is the case, we cannot display the
                        image on the page. However, it is very likely that you are still able to download the image. If that
                        fails too, try to open the image in a new tab.
